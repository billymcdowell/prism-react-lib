# Tabs

<SectionHeader
  title="Component Overview"
  description="A set of layered sections of content—known as tab panels—that are displayed one at a time."
/>

Tabs allow users to organize and navigate between multiple panels of related content within the same view, saving space and reducing clutter.

## Demo

<Canvas />

## Anatomy

1.  **Tabs (Root)**: The top-level container that manages state.
2.  **TabsList**: The container for the tab triggers.
3.  **TabsTrigger**: The interactive element (button) that activates a specific content panel.
4.  **TabsContent**: The content panel associated with a trigger.

## States
-   **Inactive**: The tab is visible but not selected.
-   **Active**: The tab is selected, and its associated content is visible. The active tab usually has a distinct background color or underline.
-   **Focus**: The tab receives a focus ring when navigated to via keyboard.
-   **Disabled**: The tab cannot be activated.

## Behavior

### Interaction patterns
-   **Click**: Clicking a tab trigger activates it and displays the corresponding content.
-   **Keyboard**:
    -   **Tab**: Moves focus into the tab list.
    -   **Arrow Keys**: Navigate between tabs within the list (automatic activation or manual depending on configuration, usually manual/enter in web).

### Responsive behavior
-   **TabsList**: Typically horizontally scrolling or wrapping on smaller screens if there are many tabs, or stacked vertically. In this implementation, it's a flex container that fits its content.
-   **TabsContent**: Expands to fill the available width.

## Usage Guidelines

<Guidelines>
  <Dos>
    - Use when users need to switch between views within the same context.
    - Use for organizing related content into distinct sections (e.g., Account, Password, Notifications).
    - Keep tab labels short and descriptive (1-2 words).
  </Dos>
  <Donts>
    - Use tabs for sequential steps (use a Stepper or Wizard instead).
    - Use tabs for comparing content (content should be visible side-by-side).
    - Overload a single view with too many tabs (consider a navigation menu or sidebar).
  </Donts>
</Guidelines>

## Accessibility

### Keyboard navigation
-   **Tab**: Moves focus into the tab list and then to the active tab panel.
-   **Arrow Right/Left**: Moves focus between tabs.
-   **Home/End**: Moves focus to the first/last tab.
-   **Space/Enter**: Activates the focused tab (if not automatically activated).

### Screen reader support
-   **Roles**:
    -   `role="tablist"` wrapper.
    -   `role="tab"` for triggers.
    -   `role="tabpanel"` for content areas.
-   **ARIA Attributes**:
    -   `aria-selected="true"` on the active tab.
    -   `aria-controls` links the tab to its panel.
    -   `aria-labelledby` links the panel to its tab.

## Design Specifications

### Typography
-   **Labels**: `text-sm`, `font-medium`.

### Colors
-   **Background**: `bg-muted` for the list, `bg-background` for the active tab.
-   **Text**: `text-muted-foreground` for inactive, `text-foreground` for active.
-   **Active State**: Shadow and color change to indicate elevation/selection.

## Implementation Notes

### Technical considerations
-   Built using `@radix-ui/react-tabs`.
-   Supports controlled and uncontrolled modes.

### Code reference
-   **Component**: `src/components/ui/tabs.tsx`
-   **Storybook**: `src/stories/tabs.stories.tsx`
-   **Dependencies**: `@radix-ui/react-tabs`
